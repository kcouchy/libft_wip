# libft
Library of functions, will add to as the 42 cursus continues.
From fract-ol: ft_atod (transforms char * input to double)


# printf

Implements the following conversions:
• %c Prints a single character.
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
• %i Prints an integer in base 10.
• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
• %% Prints a percent sign.


# get_next_line

A function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
• Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
• Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
• You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
• Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.
• Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
For example, if you can read from the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5, you should be
able to read from a different fd per call without losing the reading thread of each
file descriptor or returning a line from another fd.
It means that you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from fd 3, then
fd 4, then 5, then once again 3, once again 4, and so forth.
